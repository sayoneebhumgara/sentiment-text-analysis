Negative salon review - 

I recently visited Rose Hair Salon and I am disappointed with the results. 
Sam at Rose Hair Salon is so rude and has no knowledge regarding how to style hair. She did the worst job.
She ignored my requests, offered horrible suggestions, and gave me the worst cut and style. 
The salon's rude, entitled employees and unfriendly atmosphere made me feel so uncomfortable throughout the entire visit. 
I am beyond horrified and disappointed with my experience and do not recommend the Rose Hair Salon at all to anyone looking for good service.
