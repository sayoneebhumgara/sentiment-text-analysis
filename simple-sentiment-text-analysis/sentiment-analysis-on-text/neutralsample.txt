I recently visited Rose Hair Salon and I am not happy with the results. 
Sam at Rose Hair Salon is not good and does not have much knowledge regarding hairstyles and cuts. But she was sweet. 
She listened to my requests, offered a few suggestions, and executed the cut and style, which I did not like much.
The salon's atmosphere made me feel comfortable, but it could be more hygenic. 
All in all, it was a decent experience.
