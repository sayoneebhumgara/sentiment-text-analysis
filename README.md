In this project, I have developed a versatile Sentiment Analysis tool with a user-friendly Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI). This toolkit allows users to effortlessly detect sentiments in various contexts. Users can analyze sentiment in two primary ways:

1. Manual Text Input: Users can input any text of their choice into the Tkinter GUI, and the tool will analyze and report the sentiment associated with the provided text.
2. Article Sentiment Analysis: With just a link to an article, you can use this tool to evaluate the overall sentiment of the content. The tool will fetch the article, process it, summarize it, and provide valuable insights into the sentiments expressed within.
